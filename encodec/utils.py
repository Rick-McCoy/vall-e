def _linear_overlap_add(frames: list[Tensor], stride: int):
    # Generic overlap add, with linear fade-in/fade-out, supporting complex scenario
    # e.g., more than 2 frames per position.
    # The core idea is to use a weight function that is a triangle,
    # with a maximum value at the middle of the segment.
    # We use this weighting when summing the frames, and divide by the sum of weights
    # for each positions at the end. Thus:
    #   - if a frame is the only one to cover a position, the weighting is a no-op.
    #   - if 2 frames cover a position:
    #          ...  ...
    #         /   \/   \
    #        /    /\    \
    #            S  T       , i.e. S offset of second frame starts, T end of first frame.
    # Then the weight function for each one is: (t - S), (T - t), with `t` a given offset.
    # After the final normalization, the weight of the second frame at position `t` is
    # (t - S) / (t - S + (T - t)) = (t - S) / (T - S), which is exactly what we want.
    #
    #   - if more than 2 frames overlap at a given point, we hope that by induction
    #      something sensible happens.
